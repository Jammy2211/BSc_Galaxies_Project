Project Setup
=============

At the beginning of the `tutorial.ipynb` notebook, steps were performed to ensure auto-saving of progress,
installation of the Python libraries used by the project and downloading of the GitHub repository.

These steps are now repeated in this task notebook, make sure you run them before proceeding with the task!

Project Setup: Colab Setup
==========================

To set up Google Colab for the research project, follow these steps to ensure your progress is saved. These
instructions are also detailed in the accompanying document, which includes images for guidance.

First, connect Google Colab to your Google account and Google Drive. This setup ensures your work is autosaved and
preserved even if you close your browser tab or window. Next, open the tutorial notebook in Colab, click on
the "File" tab in the top-left corner, and select "Save a copy in Drive." This action will create a duplicate of the
notebook and open it in a new tab titled "Copy of task_filename.ipynb."

In the new tab, rename the notebook by clicking on its title in the top-left corner. Change it
from "Copy of task_filename.ipynb" to "YOUR_NAME_task_filename.ipynb," replacing "YOUR_NAME" with your actual name.
With these steps complete, the notebook will now autosave your changes to your Google Drive, ensuring your
progress is retained.

Project Setup: Software Installation
====================================

Next, install the Python software libraries required for this research project. In Google Colab, this can be done
easily by running the cell below in the Jupyter Notebook.

If prompted to restart the session after installation, do so and then rerun the cell to ensure all libraries are
properly installed.

Project Setup: Repository Clone
===============================

The code below retrieves the project files from the GitHub repository.

__Task 3: Real Galaxies__

In the folder `dataset/task_1_structure/jwst`, you will find 10 images of real galaxies observed with the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST). Your objective is to ?.

You can achieve this by applying either of the methods discussed earlier or by combining them for a more robust
classification.

Keep in mind that real galaxies are inherently complex, often exhibiting additional emission and structural features
that may not be perfectly captured by a simple light profile. As a result, the fits will likely show significantly
larger residuals compared to those from simulated galaxies.

Analyzing these residuals can offer further insights into ?
