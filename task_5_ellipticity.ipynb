    "The ellipticity of galaxies is a fundamental property that describes their shape.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It quantifies a galaxy’s shape as the ellipse that best matches its observed light distribution, with ellipticity\n",
    "defined as the ratio of the difference between the major and minor axes to their sum, reflecting how elongated a galaxy appears.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ellipticity provides insights into a galaxy's formation and evolution. Galaxies with low axis ratios (high ellipticity) \n",
    "are typically elliptical galaxies in Edwin Hubble's classification, characterized by spheroidal shapes, random stellar \n",
    "orbits, and little star formation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, disk galaxies, with higher axis ratios (lower ellipticity), have flat, rotating disks and often show \n",
    "spiral arms or other features of ongoing star formation. Their lower ellipticity reflects their rotational symmetry \n",
    "and flattened structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ellipticity also relates to a galaxy’s 3D shape. The observed ellipticity changes with a galaxy's inclination. \n",
    "When viewed edge-on, a galaxy appears more elongated, leading to higher ellipticity, while a face-on view shows a \n",
    "more circular shape with lower ellipticity. Thus, ellipticity is a projection of the galaxy's true 3D structure, and \n",
    "accounting for inclination helps astronomers infer whether a galaxy is spheroidal or disk-like.\n",

In this case, the minor axis (b) is shorter than the other two axes, with the galaxy's major axis (a) and the third axis (c) being longer. This creates a disk-like or lenticular shape, with a shape resembling a flattened spheroid.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Triaxial**: A more complex shape where all three axes are different lengths. The axes (a), (b), and (c) are distinct, leading to an asymmetrical shape that doesn't exhibit simple symmetry along any axis. This results in a more irregular, elongated shape in 3D. \n",
