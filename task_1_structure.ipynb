    "Galaxy structure refers to the fundamental characteristics of galaxies, which are generally grouped into three main\n",
    "structural categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ellipticals:** Galaxies with a smooth, featureless light profile, where stellar orbits are randomly oriented and \"velocity dispersion supported.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disk galaxies:** Galaxies with a more intricate light profile, characterized by stellar orbits predominantly in a rotating disk, making them \"rotationally supported.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Irregulars:** Galaxies that do not fit into the first two categories, often displaying complex or asymmetric light profiles, such as those resulting from merger events.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by using light profile fitting tools on simulated galaxies to distinguish between elliptical and disk\n",
    "galaxies, employing one of the methods astronomers use for galaxy classification. We will not consider irregular\n",
    "galaxies in this project, which are difficult to fit with light profiles due to their complex structure.\n",

    "Next, we will apply these tools to James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images of real galaxies to classify a small sample\n",

    "\n",
    "To classify galaxies as elliptical or disk galaxies, the following light profile fitting method is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elliptical galaxies**: These typically exhibit a Sersic light profile with a `sersic_index` ranging from 2.5 to 4.0. Thus, if a Sersic profile fitted to a galaxy results in an inferred `sersic_index` above 2.5, the galaxy is likely elliptical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disk galaxies**: These generally have a Sersic light profile with a `sersic_index` of 1.0. Therefore, if a Sersic profile fitted to a galaxy yields an inferred `sersic_index` below 2.5, the galaxy is likely a disk galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the folder `dataset/task_1_structure`, where you will find two simulated galaxy datasets: `disk` and `elliptical`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the light profile fitting tools to fit a Sersic light profile to each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verify that the fitting results align with the true `sersic_index` values:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The galaxy dataset named `disk` has a true `sersic_index` of **1.0**.\n",
    "   - The galaxy dataset named `elliptical` has a true `sersic_index` of **4.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By successfully fitting the Sersic profile and recovering these values, you will confirm the accuracy of your light profile fitting tools."
