    "\n",
    "__Overview__\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by using light profile fitting tools on simulated galaxies to distinguish between elliptical and disk\n",
    "galaxies, employing one of the methods astronomers use for galaxy classification. We will not consider irregular\n",
    "galaxies in this project, which are difficult to fit with light profiles due to their complex structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Disk galaxies**: These generally have a Sersic light profile with a `sersic_index` of 1.0. Therefore, if a Sersic profile fitted to a galaxy yields an inferred `sersic_index` below 2.5, the galaxy is likely a disk galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the folder `dataset/task_1_structure`, where you will find two simulated galaxy datasets: `disk` and `elliptical`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the light profile fitting tools to fit a Sersic light profile to each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verify that the fitting results align with the true `sersic_index` values:\n",
