BSc Galaxy Morphology Project
=============================

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks and data for the BSc project on galaxy morphology.

The project can be completed at an online web server by following the link below:

Project Structure
-----------------

The project consists of four Jupiter notebooks which each describe a different aspect of galaxy morphology analysis.

The notebooks are as follows:

- ``tutorial_1_grids_and_galaxies.ipynb``: How grids of (y,x) coordinates are used to create images of galaxies that ultimately quantify their morphology.
- ``tutorial_2_data.ipynb``: Simulating and inspecting telescope imaging data of a galaxy, for example from the Hubble Space Telescope.
- ``tutorial_3_fitting.ipynb``: How to fit imaging data of a galaxy and quantify whether a fit is good or bad.
- ``tutorial_4_non_linear_searches.ipynb``: Performing model-fitting via a non-linear search to find the best-fit models describing a galaxy's morphology.

The workspace includes the following additional directories:

- ``scripts``: **PyAutoLens** examples written as Python scripts.
- ``dataset``: Where data is stored, including example datasets distributed.


Workspace Version
-----------------

This version of the workspace is built and tested for using **PyAutoGalaxy v2024.9.21.2**.
